This is an experiment in using Theano for the statistical analysis of dynamic systems,with a focus on epidemiological modeling. Files in the /hmm directory show a simple implementation of a hidden markov model, using both Theano and pure Numpy.

Files in the /trans directory are the beginning of a spatial transmission model, 
but this is decidedly a work in progress.
